//! A set of image processing functions that operate on [`ImageBuffer`]s.
//!
//! # Common Principles
//!
//! This section explains the general rules common to all ImageBufAlgo
//! functions. Only exceptions to these rules will be explained in the
//! subsequent listings of all the individual ImageBufAlgo functions.
//!
//! ## Return Values and Error Messages
//!
//! Most functions that produce image data come in two forms:
//!
//! 1. Return an `ImageBuffer`.
//!
//!    The return value is a new ImageBuf containing the result image. In this
//! case, an entirely new image will be created to hold the result. In case of
//! error, the result image returned can have any error conditions checked with
//! has_error() and geterror().
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Method 1: Return an image result
//!    let dest = ImageBuffer::from_over(fg, bg)?;
//!    ```
//!
//! 2. Modify an existing `ImageBuffer`.
//!
//!    The function is called on a destination `ImageBuffer` where the results
//!    will be stored.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Method 2: Write into an existing image
//!    fg.over(&bg)?;
//!    ```
//!
//! 3. Chaining
//!
//!    Most functions that take &mut self as an argument will return this from
//! the    function call. This allows you to chain calls together.
//!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // Chaining methods
//!    let mut dest = ImageBuffer::new_with(100, 100, TypeDesc::FLOAT)?;
//!
//!    // Compose a 42Â° rotated text over the `dest` buffer.
//!    dest.over(
//!        &ImageBuffer::from_render_text(0, 0, "HelloWorld!")?
//!            .rotate(42.0)?
//!    )?;
//!    ```
//!
//! For a small minority of functions, there are only input images, and no image
//! outputs (e.g., `is_monochrome()`). In such cases, the error message should
//! be retrieved from the first input image.
//!
//! ## Region of Interest
//!
//! Most functions take an optional [`Options::region_of_interest`] parameter
//! that restricts the operation to a range in x, y, z, and channels.
//! [`RegionOfInterest::default()`] (also known as [`RegionOfInterest::All`])
//! means no region restriction -- the whole image will be copied or altered.
//!
//! For functions with that modify an exisiting destination `ImageBuffer` that
//! is already initialized (i.e. allocated with a particular size and
//! data type), the operation will be performed on the pixels in the destination
//! that overlap the `RegionOfInterest`, leaving pixels in the destination which
//! are outside the `RegionOfInterest` unaltered.
//!
//! The the [`RegionOfInterest`] (if set) determines the size of the result
//! image. If the ROI is the default All, the result image size will be the
//! union of the pixel data windows of the input images and have a data type
//! determined by the data types of the input images.
//!
//! Most functions also respect the `channel` member of the `RegionOfInterest`,
//! thus restricting the channel range on which the operation is performed. The
//! `RegionOfInterest::default()` sets up the `RegionOfInterest` to specify
//! that the operation should be performed on all channels of the input
//! image(s).
//!
//! ## Constant And Per-Channel Values
//!
//! Many ImageBuffer methods take per-channel constant-valued arguments (for
//! example, a fill color). These parameters are passed as `[f32]` slices.
//! These are generally expected to have length equal to the number of channels.
//! But you may also pass a slice containing only single `f32` which will be
//! used as the value for allchannels. More generally, what is happening is that
//! the last value supplied is replicated for any missing channel.
//!
//! Some functions have parameters of type `ImageOrConst`, which may take either
//! an `ImageBuffer` reference, or a per-channel constant, or a single constant
//! to be used for all channels.
//!
//! ## Multithreading
//!
//! All functions take an optional [`thread_count`](Options::thread_count)
//! parameter that signifies the maximum number of threads to use to parallelize
//! the operation. The default value for `thread_count` is `0`, which signifies
//! that the number of thread should be the OIIO global default set by
//! [`set_attribute()`], which itself defaults to be the detected level of
//! hardware concurrency (number of cores available).
//!
//! Generally you can ignore this parameter (or pass `0`), meaning to use *all*
//! the cores available in order to perform the computation as quickly as
//! possible. The main reason to explicitly pass a different number (generally
//! `1`) is if the application is multi-threaded at a high level, and the thread
//! calling the function just wants to continue doing the computation without
//! spawning additional threads, which might tend to crowd out the other
//! application threads.
